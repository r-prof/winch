<!-- badges: end -->

Winch provides stack traces for call chains that cross between R and C function calls.
This is a useful tool for developers of R packages where a substantial portion of the code is C or C++.


## Installation

Install the released version of winch from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/) with:

``` r
install.packages("winch")
```

Install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("r-lib/winch")
```



## Example

Below is an example where an R function calls into C which calls back into R. 
Note the second-to-last entry in the trace:

```{r example}
library(winch)

foo <- function() {
  winch_call(bar)
}

bar <- function() {
  winch_trace_back()
}

foo()
```

`rlang::entrace()` checks if winch is installed, and adds a native backtrace.
As this cannot be easily demonstrated in a knitr document, the output is copied from a GitHub Actions run.

```{r error, eval = FALSE}
options(
  error = rlang::entrace,
  rlang_backtrace_on_error = "full",
  rlang_trace_use_winch = TRUE
)

vctrs::vec_as_location(quote, 2)
```

```
Error: Must subset elements with a valid subscript vector.
✖ Subscript has the wrong type `function`.
ℹ It must be logical, numeric, or character.
Backtrace:
    █
 1. └─vctrs::vec_as_location(quote, 2)
 2.   └─`/vctrs.so`::vctrs_as_location()
 3.     └─`/vctrs.so`::vec_as_location_opts()
 ```


## How does it work?

winch uses a very simple heuristic.
R's traceback (and also profiling) infrastructure introduces the notion of a "context".
Every call to an R function opens a new context and closes it when execution of the function ends.
Unfortunately, no new context is established for native code called with `.Call()` or `.External()`.
Establishing contexts expends precious run time, so this may be the reason for the omission.

To work around this limitation, the source code of all R functions along the call chain is scanned for instances of `.Call` and `.External`.
The native call stack (obtained via [libunwind](https://github.com/libunwind/libunwind) or [libbacktrace](https://github.com/ianlancetaylor/libbacktrace)) is scanned for chunks of code outside of `libR.so` (R's main library) -- these are assumed to correspond to `.Call()` or `.External()`.
The native traces are embedded as artificial calls into the R stack trace.

## Limitations

- The matching will not be perfect, but it may still lead to faster discovery of the cause of an error.
- On Windows winch only works on x64, and there the traces can be obtained only for one shared library at a time. 
See `winch_init_library()` for details.
